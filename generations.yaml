    description: "The Renault Zoe (stylized ZOE), known as Renault Zoe E-Tech Electric since 2021, is a five-door supermini electric car produced by the French manufacturer Renault from 2012 to 2024. The Zoe was based on the platform of the Renault Clio and represented one of the first mass-market electric vehicles from a mainstream European manufacturer. Retail customer deliveries began in France in December 2012, followed by other European countries in 2013. The Zoe became Europe's best-selling electric vehicle for multiple years and ranks as one of the all-time best-selling plug-in electric cars in Europe. Production ended on March 30, 2024 after nearly twelve years, with a total of 426,706 units manufactured. The Zoe was replaced by the retro-styled Renault 5 E-Tech.\n\nThe Zoe underwent several significant updates during its production run:\n\n**Initial Production (2012-June 2015)**: Powered by a 22 kWh lithium-ion battery providing an NEDC range of 130-150 miles, driven by a synchronous electric motor (Q90/R90) producing approximately 88 horsepower. Featured the innovative 'Chameleon' charger allowing AC charging at any level up to 43 kW.\n\n**ZE 40 Update (October 2016-September 2019)**: Introduced a new 41 kWh lithium-ion battery developed with LG Chem, increasing the NEDC range to approximately 250 miles. The battery weighed 305 kg and was mounted on Zoes using the R75/90 motor. Older Zoes could also be upgraded to this battery.\n\n**ZE 50 Facelift (June 2019-2024)**: A comprehensive update featuring a new 52 kWh battery (55 kWh total capacity) providing up to 245 miles of WLTP range. Paired with more powerful electric motors: the R110 producing 107 horsepower or the R135 with 134 horsepower. For the first time, DC fast charging capability via CCS2 was introduced (up to 50 kW). The exterior received updated styling with LED headlights, while the interior was overhauled with improved materials and Renault's Easy Link infotainment system. Advanced driver assistance systems were also added including lane-keeping assist and automatic emergency braking.\n\nThe Zoe was produced at Renault's Flins plant in France alongside the Clio and Nissan Micra. It was available with various battery ownership models including full purchase or battery leasing options depending on the market."
